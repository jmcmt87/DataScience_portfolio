This is my data science portfolio.

All these are non-guided projects.


* **Titanic Machine Learning project with Python** (Titanic_top25.ipynb): this classification machine learning model made it in the top 25% of the Kaggle Titanic competition.
* **Credit Approval Machine Learning project with R** (credit_approval_R.rmd): visit https://rpubs.com/JMarcos_87/730835 to see results.
* **PCA using Numpy** (PCA_Numpy.ipynb): Performing PCA on the renowned iris dataset using the Numpy library.
* **Twitter Basic Sentiment Analysis** (Basict_sentiment_analysis.ipynb): Basic sentiment analysis using plain Python with the help of Pandas and Regex libraries. It uses external data
